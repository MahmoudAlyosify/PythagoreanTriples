# PythagoreanTriples
 A right triangle can have sides whose lengths are all integers. The set of three integer values for the side lengths of a right triangle is called a Pythagorean triple. The side lengths must satisfy the relationship that the sum of the squares of two of the sides is equal to the square of the hypotenuse. Write an app to find all Pythagorean triples for side1, side2 and the hypotenuse.
